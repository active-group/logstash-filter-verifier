logstash-filter-verifier (1.4.1) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Fix for a crash when using --sockets with a testcase file without
    a "fields" option.

logstash-filter-verifier (1.4.0) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Full support for Logstash 5 and later. By default the version used
    with LFV is auto-detected (in order to adapt the LFV behavior) but
    this can be overridden with --logstash-version.
  * --logstash-path no longer sets the singular Logstash path but rather
    adds an extra entry to the list of locations that are checked for a
    Logstash installation.
  * When using --sockets a magic [@metadata][__lfv_testcase] field was
    added, but it would clobber any existing @metadata fields. This field
    is now appended to any existing @metadata fields.

logstash-filter-verifier (1.3.0) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * The --sockets option is incompatible with a couple of input codecs
    that happen to work if you don't use that option. Warn the use about
    this.
  * Addition of a --logstash-arg option that allows the user to pass
    additional arguments to all started Logstash processes.
  * The PATH environment variable is by default passed on to started
    Logstash processes. This fixes a bug where Logstash under some
    circumstances isn't able to find the JVM.

logstash-filter-verifier (1.2.1) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Addition of --sockets-timeout option to control how long to
    wait for Logstash to start up and become ready to process
    events when using the --sockets option.
  * Status and progress messages are now written to stdout instead
    of stderr.
  * Addition of a "description" field for test cases that e.g. can be
    used as a short piece of documentation.

 -- Magnus Bäck <magnus@noun.se>  Wed, 5 Apr 2017 22:07:33 +0200

logstash-filter-verifier (1.2.0) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Logstash 5.2 compatibility. Issues still exist with Logstash 5.0
    and possibly 5.1.
  * Addition of --sockets option that causes the program to use Unix
    domain sockets to pass inputs to Logstash, enabling a single
    Logstash process to be used for multiple test case files which
    has the potential to dramatically shorten the execution time.
  * Go 1.8 is now required for compiling.
  * Support for a new test case file format where pairs of input and
    expected output lines are store together. For now both formats
    work.
  * Addition of --logstash-output option that causes the Logstash
    output to be emitted.
  * JSON parse errors for test case files are reported with line and
    column details to make it easier to find the problem.
  * The makefile now supports a GOPATH variable with multiple paths.
  * When adding fields to input events with the `fields` option, nested
    fields may now be objects.
  * Large floating point numbers are now formatted in a way that's
    acceptable to Logstash.
  * Minor improvements in the messages given when running the program.

logstash-filter-verifier (1.1.1) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Multiple filter configuration files now work. Previously only one
    of the files would be picked up by Logstash, possibly resulting in
    incorrect test results.
  * When invoking with --help to get command-line help, the exit code
    is now zero.

 -- Magnus Bäck <magnus@noun.se>  Sun, 31 Jul 2016 17:59:04 +0200

logstash-filter-verifier (1.1.0) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Adds the --keep-env option to keep select environment variables
    when invoking Logstash. Useful to propagate JAVA_HOME and any
    other variables needed by Logstash.
  * If the Logstash child process terminates with a non-zero exit code,
    show the stdout/stderr output from the command rather than solely
    relying on the log output. If Logstash fails very early, e.g. before
    the JVM starts up, there won't be a logfile.

 -- Magnus Bäck <magnus@noun.se>  Thu, 25 Feb 2016 21:48:28 +0100

logstash-filter-verifier (1.0.1) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Fixes Logstash 2.2.0 incompatibility problem.
  * If the Logstash child process terminates with a non-zero exit code,
    the contents of Logstash's log file is now included in the error
    message.

 -- Magnus Bäck <magnus@noun.se>  Thu, 11 Feb 2016 21:09:28 +0100

logstash-filter-verifier (1.0.0) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Initial release.
