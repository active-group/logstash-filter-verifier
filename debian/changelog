logstash-filter-verifier (1.1.1) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Multiple filter configuration files now work. Previously only one
    of the files would be picked up by Logstash, possibly resulting in
    incorrect test results.
  * When invoking with --help to get command-line help, the exit code
    is now zero.

logstash-filter-verifier (1.1.0) RELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Adds the --keep-env option to keep select environment variables
    when invoking Logstash. Useful to propagate JAVA_HOME and any
    other variables needed by Logstash.
  * If the Logstash child process terminates with a non-zero exit code,
    show the stdout/stderr output from the command rather than solely
    relying on the log output. If Logstash fails very early, e.g. before
    the JVM starts up, there won't be a logfile.
